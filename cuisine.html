        <h2>Evolution of Indian Gastronomy: A Tale of Fusion</h2>
        <p>
The Indian culinary culture is a product of historical and cultural developments spanning over thousands of years. Indian cuisine can be best described as a "palimpsest", which denotes something which contains multiple layers or aspects beneath the surface, with each layer exerting an unalterable impact upon the whole. Cultural exchanges occurring as a result of trade, travel, conquests and invasions have all contributed towards its culinary heritage.
