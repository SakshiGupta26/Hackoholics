        <h2>What language do they speak in India? Is there any one traditional language in India?</h2>
        <p>These are fair questions if you’re traveling to India, doing business in India, or seeking Indian language services for any number of purposes.  However, the only simple answer is: There is no single language that’s consistently spoken across this vast, vibrant, and incredibly multilingual nation
        </p>Having recently overtaken China as the most populous country in the world, India’s more than 1.4 billion citizens represent an incredibly rich, diverse, and complex linguistic landscape encompassing more than 19,500 mother tongues in 28 different states across more than 3.2 million square kilometres.  
        <p>Sound overwhelming?  Wondering where to begin?

There’s no doubt that exploring India’s thousands of mother tongues and dialects in depth could take many lifetimes.  </p>
          <p>The good news is: Gaining a fundamental understanding of the country’s language structure that will allow you to begin communicating effectively with your target audience can be accomplished much more quickly.</p>
            <p>Below, we’ve provided a brief history of language in India, an overview of the country’s officially recognized languages, and a note on the role of English.  If you’re seeking high quality Indian language translation and interpretive services but aren’t sure where to begin, CanTalk can help</p>

        <h2>The History of Language in India</h2>
        <p>
The languages spoken in India primarily belong to two major language families: Indo-Aryan languages (northern India) and Dravidian languages (southern India). Other less prevalent language families include Austroasiatic, Sino-Tibetan, and Tai-Kadai.
        </p>
        <p>Proto-Dravidian languages date back as far as the 4th millennium BC while Old Indo-Aryan evolved around 1500 BC. Over thousands of years, regional and cultural influences have shaped the vast array of distinct languages and dialects spoken throughout the Indian nation.</p>
<p>How Many Languages Are Actually Spoken in India?
Incredibly, the 2011 Census of India reported more than 19,500 mother tongues, 121 of which are languages with more than 10,000 speakers. For an in-depth overview of the country’s languages and a breakdown of where they’re spoken, access the Language Atlas of India.

 <p>The 22 Officially Recognized Languages of India
Fortunately, if you’re seeking Indian language services, it’s unlikely that you’ll have to translate content into tens of thousands of different languages.  This is because in May of 2008, the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India laid out a list of 22 official Indian languages (also known as scheduled languages). </p>
